# Or How do put your Oppressor in a Skinner Box
I’ve been hearing a bunch about volatiles and stables lately, about how we are all the same basically, just in different parts of a transition from volatile to stable in an ever waging war of 0...1...2...3...4
And we is the team they use veterans of a war?  Some of us want to end the war.  End the obsession on shipping, resource allocation, and perks.
Some veterans want to end the war. 
* “Volatile” engineers often get thrown away or placed in positions of ill advised power.
* “Stable” engineers often get ignored or promoted to dead-end middle management.
* Technology follows predictable patterns empowering or replacing the ones that come before it, most attempts to force innovation end in boom or bust cycles.
Decision making is a collective process get over it, software has multiple levels, and most companies fail.  We have been told and told to celebrate failure “its part of startup culture”.

## Here we get to the toxin
Startups, large round VC funded companies, fail more readily than small businesses oriented around software

Who gains from this; money managers team starters making large salaries, selling off IP and email passwords.  Requiring high success rates across large portfolios to shooting for larger profits leveraging statistics.

## Whats the symptoms
Little competent oversight and abuse
> Stephen, a guy we hired as a temporary contractor to tidy up our database layer, grabbed the greenest of engineers, moved into the ping-pong room, and told the engineer, “We are not leaving this room until we can see the application actually work.”

This doesn’t sound like something we should celebrate to make investment vehicles.  Sleep is good for your brain and thinking just a few minutes ahead avoids many obstacles.
Let me explain that I am stating my values
* the health of the workers over the health of the market
* the health of the software and documentation over sexiness
* prototyping over expecting(friday projects are life bloods)
* anti-lockin build things for change

Now for all of this what do we get?
* Worker burnout and probable failure
* Technically uninteresting(or hobbled) projects
* Failures to evolve, entire life cycles trashes

## What happens when you survive?
So your long hours have paid off, metrics met, investors happy  no real income yet *probably* but buzz and users and early adopters.  Its time for a vacation right?  No its time for what have you done for me latelies to rain down and ignore technical debt.  Frustrated management organizes more hackathons, coding sprints.  All in an attempt reinvigorate a fire that wasn't there.  We hire new people either put them under or beside the old members and see what happens.
An engineers first response is going to be to promote the old guard, we are classically bad at this especially under stress and with high levels of developer vs. manager unrest.  We tend to promote our sharks when we expect to have to innovate more, we put people with anti-social behaviors at the heads of projects.  We do this because we hate management and we severely want to get push back on technical problems or just push deadlines off enough to catch some breath.
So we say behavior like this is  necessary to innovate, that these behaviors are not just correlated with genius but a part of or required for it.  Mostly based off the reason that this is how we do it and how its always been done.
## Doing things this ways sucks!
Not many people understand how seriously bad this sucks and how little actually gets done because of it.  Heres a big secret most new technologies are just rebuilding software thats that have been in open source for years.
