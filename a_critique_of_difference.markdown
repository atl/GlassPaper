#A Critique of Difference

I've just gotten back from a weekend in the Northern California mountains where I spent two days soaking in hot springs and hiking with a group of beautiful queers. The experience was just what I needed and I've come back feeling considerably more centered. The only trouble is the history of the resort and the homogeneity of its patrons.

On Friday I drove up past the Napa Valley and across a mountain to a clothing optional New Age-themed resort and met up with a dozen or so acquaintances. Upon getting there, we immediately began critiquing the cultural appropriation of Buddhist, Hindu, and Native American cultures. We commented on the pipe ceremony that a bunch of white people were doing. One of my friends read about the history of the resort, which was originally a place of gathering and worship by the Patwin and possibly the Wappo peoples. It was commercially established much later in 1860 by settlers.

This settlement has evolved into a fancy resort for the young professional and aging yoga instructor alike. My friends and I are of course above all of this; we have proven this to ourselves by pointing all of this out to each other. We just came here to be naked in nature, cook food with friends, and escape the city & our day jobs.

It is this hypocrisy that is really eating at me. We might have enough political savvy not to go to a pipe ceremony or read a Kindle in the meditation pool. However, we still desire to be there and bask in our own privilege. Not only that, but while doing so, we have to see ourselves as better than the other Petite bourgeoisie while seeking out the same comforts and setting examples others will later follow.  

This harkens back to other subjects such appropriation and gentrification, in which artists and taste makers create a vanguard movement that can then be consumed by upwardly mobile hipsters. The recent Miley Cyrus twerking scandal is a good example of how intersectional communities can be breeding grounds for future cultural appropriation.

If you are familiar with Big Freedia or Sissy Bounce, you will know that queer people of color have played a major role in the rise in popularity of twerking, as well as voguing.  So it is not surprising that queers (and their friends/allies) of all ethnicities would take them up as personal idols. But similar to how co-ops and artist spaces springing up in low-income communities is the first wave of gentrification, the use of twerking by pop stars to sex up their image is done so while whitewashing and homogenizing its roots.

Now we all deserve some downtime and the space to look inward and commune with nature or whatever, but doing this without self-critique is meaningless. How can we build these kinds of spaces without perpetuating the same behaviors that led our parents generations down the path of acceptance and consumerism?
