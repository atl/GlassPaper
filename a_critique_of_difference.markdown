#A Critique of Difference

I've just gotten back from weekend in the Northern California mountains where I spent two days soaking in hot springs and hiking with a group of beautiful queers.  The experience was just what I needed and I've come back feeling considerably more centered, the only trouble is the history of the resort and the homogeneity of its patrons.

On Friday I drove up past the Napa valley and across a mountain to a clothing optional New Age themed resort and met up with a dozen or so acquaintances.  Upon getting there we immediately began critiquing the cultural appropriation of Buddhist, Hindu, and Native American culture.  We commented on the pipe ceremony that a bunch of white people were doing.  One of my friends read about the resorts history, which was originally a place of gathering and worship by the Patwin and possibly the Wappo peoples.  Later commercially establish in 1860 by settlers.

This settlement has evolved into a fancy resort for the young professional and aging yoga instructor alike.  My friends and I are of course above all of this, we have proven this to ourselves by pointing all of this out to each other.  We just came here to be naked in nature, cook food with friends, and escape the city & our day jobs.

Its this hypocrisy thats really eating at me, we might have enough political savvy not to go to a pipe ceremony or read kindle in the meditation pool. However, we still desire to be there and bask in our own privilege.  Not only that but while doing so we have to see ourselves as better than the other Petite bourgeoisie while seeking out the same comforts and setting examples others will later follow.  

This harkens back to other subjects such a appropriation and gentrification, in which artists and taste makers create a vanguard movement which can then be consumed by upwardly mobile hipsters.  The recent Miley Ray Cyrus twerking scandal is a good example of how intersectional communities can be breeding grounds for future cultural appropriation.

If your familiar with Big Freedia or Sissy Bounce you'll know that queer people of color have played a major role in rise in popularity of twreking as well as voguing.  So its not surprising that queers(and their friends/allies) of all ethnicities would take them up as personal idols.  But similar to how Co-Ops and artist spaces spring up in low income communities is first wave of gentrification, the use of twerking by pop stars to sex up their image is done so while whitewashing and homogenizing its roots.

Now we all deserve some downtime and the space to look inward and commune with nature or whatever but doing this without self-critique is meaningless.  How can we build these kind of spaces without perpetuating the same behaviours that lead our parents generations down the path of acceptance and consumerism?
