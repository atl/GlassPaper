# Or How do put your Oppressor in a Skinner Box
I’ve been hearing a bunch about volatiles and stables lately, about how we are all the same basically, just in different parts of a transition from volatile to stable in an ever waging war of 0...1...2...3...4
And we is the team they use veterans of a war?  Some of us want to end the war.  End the obsession on shipping, resource allocation, and perks.
Some veterans want to end the war. 
* “Volatile” engineers often get thrown away or placed in positioned of illadvisoable power.
* “Stable” engineers often get ignored or promoted to deadend middle management.
* Technology follows predictable patterns empowering or replacing the ones that come before it, most attempts to force inovation end in boom or bust cycles.
Decision making is a collective process get over it, software has multiple levels, and most companies fail.  We have been told and told to celebrate failure “its part of startup culture”.

## Here we get to the toxin
Startups, large round VC funded companies, fail more readily than small businesses oriented around software[src]:(http://www.inc.com/mark-peter-davis/why-you-should-not-raise-venture-capital-money.html).  Who gains from this; money managers team starters making large salaries, selling off IP and email passwords.  Requiring high success rates across large portfolios to shooting for larger profits leveraging statistics.

## Whats the symtoms
Little competent oversight and abuse
> Stephen, a guy we hired as a temporary contractor to tidy up our database layer, grabbed the greenest of engineers, moved into the ping-pong room, and told the engineer, “We are not leaving this room until we can see the application actually work.”

This doesn’t sound like something we should celebrate to make investment vehicles.  Sleep is good for your brain and thinking just afew minutes ahead avoids many obstacles.
Let me explain that I am stating my values
* the health of the workers over the health of the market
* the health of the software and documentation over sexyness
* prototyping over expecting(friday projects are life bloods)
* anti-lockin build things for change
