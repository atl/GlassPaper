# Or How do put your Oppressor into a Skinner Box
I’ve been hearing a bunch about volatiles and stables lately; about how we are all the same basically, just in different parts of a transition from volatile to stable in an ever waging war of versions 0.0...1.0...2.0...

I don't just use the word war casually I hear it again and again.  Each company is in a war to win, each sprint is a battle, each all nighter is a new boot camp.  We talk about getting to version "one zero" like its a death march; because it is.  Not all veterans come home patriotic (not all come home at all), and some of us want to end the war.  End the obsession on shipping products.  End the scramble for resource allocation. End the obsession with a culture of perks.  So that we can build something worthwhile for the betterment of everyone.

## Here we get to the toxin
Like most wars the enemy isn't always what the generals tell you; often it's the generals themselves.  Typically we are told this war is users, deadlines, other companies, and funding. By coaching programmers to be "volatile" and "stable," we create enemies out of what were once comrades and forget to realize that these same tactics strengthen the power divide between business owners and employees.

Ultimately the sharks and the parasites in our community are not as separate or safe from everyone else as they expect.  Startups, large round VC funded companies, fail more readily than small businesses oriented around software

Who gains from this? Money managers-team starters making large salaries, selling off IP and email passwords, requiring high success rates across large portfolios to shoot for larger profits leveraging statistics.

### Dichotomies Matter
Its not a coincidence that we keep revisiting the same issues in the projects and companies we build.  When we couch people as "volatile" vs. "stable" we don't acknowledge the underlying power dynamics creating them-we simply seek to reproduce the same failing environments.  Ones where people with violent anti-social behavior are able to piss all over their own personal parts of the noosphere and professional baby sitters make their stakes taming these beasts.

* “Volatile” engineers often get thrown away or placed in positions of ill-advised power.
* “Stable” engineers often get ignored or promoted to dead-end middle management.
* Technologies follow predictable patterns-each empowers or replaces the ones that come before it. Most attempts to force innovation end in boom or bust cycles.

We don't build these dichotomies to accurately explain human behavior, we do it to normalize maladaptive behaviors which superficially seem structually uneconomical. Teaching people to work in teams is something we ultimately have to start implementing at younger ages. Not just in sports teams or social groups, but in making making collective technical decisions together which requires setting aside egos on completely different levels.  Decision making is a collective process and as a culture we should get over it. Software has multiple levels and most companies fail.  We have been told and told to celebrate failure because “it's part of startup culture”. This concept is bull shit. 

### Whats the symptoms?
Misnomering startup as *culture* is a painful use of language and has drastic implications. At a conference recently I was told a story about a successful startup and how they cleverly solved the unavoivable problems associated with development culture.

doesn’t sound like something we should celebrate to make investment vehicles.  Sleep is good for your brain and thinking just a few minutes ahead avoids many obstacles. Now for all of this what do we get?

* Worker burnout and probable failure
* Technically uninteresting (or hobbled) projects
* Failures to evolve/entire life cycles trashes
* Little competent oversight and abuse
* Focus on investibility over viability
* Usery and rent seeking behaviour against user base

## What happens when you survive?
So your long hours have paid off, metrics have been met, and your investors are now happy. No real income yet *probably*, but buzz and users and early adopters. It's time for a vacation, right?  No. It's time for "what have you done for me latelies" to rain down and ignore technical debt.  Frustrated management organizes, more hackathons, coding sprints.  All in an attempt reinvigorate a fire that wasn't there.  We only hire new people to experiment with placing them either them under or beside the old members.

An engineer's first response is going to be promoting the old guard. We are classically bad at this-especially under stress and with high levels of "developer vs. manager" unrest.  We tend to promote our sharks when we expect to require innovation. We put people with anti-social behaviors at the head of projects.  We do this because we hate management and we severely want to get push-back on technical problems or just push deadlines off enough to catch some breath.

So we say behavior like this is  necessary to innovate-that these behaviors are not just correlated with genius but a part of or required for it. That this is how we do it and this is how its always been done.

## Doing things this ways sucks!
Not many people understand how seriously bad this sucks and how little actually gets done because of it.  But here's a big secret: most new technologies are simply rebuilds of software that have already been in open source for years.  We either organize our core products on content(*shrugs*) or around some special magic that makes a result really, really easy; but these products still rest on well understood foundations.  
So most companies don't focus on this, they focus on making something that is shippable-which really means "works for investors".   Building the image of a product or service is easy-I've seen people get by with a power point. Building the actual product is often an epic task of weighing solutions and picking new teams.  So when the time comes we add constraints to the product and people who remind us of ourselves.  We avoid achieving core goals while building new adapters and features focusing on expansion rather than accessibility/flexibility.
Since we can't change elementary education for our current generation we have to approach this as a eminent problem.  

## Kings can't live without Serfs
What scares people like Linus more than anything is that they don't serve a real purporse for us. For every king of every little kernel there's already someone with enough knowledge and intelligence to take over the project from them. Often even with the ability to communicate and organize on longer timescales.  We create cults of personality not because it's functional but in fact because of cultural assumptions around intelligence.

The real question should become "why do we choose this situation"?  Technology is too young a field to be bitterly entrenched, who can really be an expert in a field that is only 5-20 years old?  The main part of the "Unix philosophy" is to iterate quickly, build anew, and hold no cows sacred.  Well, let me tell you-developer toxicity is not a feature, its a bug.
