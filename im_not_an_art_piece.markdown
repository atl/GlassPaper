#I am not an Art Piece

I'm feeling pretty sad today but I don't really want to talk about my life in an open forum.  So lets talk about something that make me sad in general and on a daily basis, its probably the root cause of everything else anyways.  

Almost everyday friends, co-workers, acquaintances, and strangers misgender me.  I'm not really sure of the best way to deal with it.  Half the time its people who I'm never going to see again but its also friends that I hold onto and people I see everyday.  More than misgendering strangers will confront me on the street some will ask me if that red dress is a dare, call me faggot, follow me around or point.

The really bad stuff is sparse and so I can almost forget about it(and then its back).  But more often I find it to be just something for random strangers to comment on how its cool or brave or weird.  One person while at a local blue grass festival came up to me saying.

> I've seen some many beautiful dogs and art today and I couldn't comment on them, some men wear a dress and just don't pull it off but I you just do I think thats radical.

Cis people I know that sounds basically innocent to you but within afew sentences(I paraphrased) this woman had compared me to a art and dogs, had misgendered me, made some attempt at commenting on my level of passing, and bothered me during a conversation to tell me something I already knew.  That I was on display for people who thought what I was doing was an act or something to comment on.

This person didn't know I was vain but that I prefer compliments specific and real.  I was a hot mess that day in a black dress that makes my pot belly show covered in dirt from head to tow.  Maybe she was saying she liked how I moved my body or that I was playing the tomboy but she didn't tell me this.  So all I felt was noticed and spotted out.  She didn't even try and spark a conversation but just moved back into the crowd.

If I make myself up and put on a costume(or formal where) feel free to say "Oh HAI I love the Betty Boup outfit."  If your my acquaintance maybe say "hey the makes your back look really nice"  If I'm alone at a conference don't do a drive by "I love that dress", come and talk to me instead.  Allies are people that make others feel safer(and that read fucking books).

On the rare occasion when a random stranger walks up to me and gives me drive by validation(kids please don't try this at home) it goes something like this "omg I love those stockings on you but they always ride down on me cause my thighs are too thick."  From this I get a sense of comradery and not difference or isolation.  

Its because this person is letting me join their club, basically without even having to have the same identity but through shared experience, that I don't feel completely isolated.  So next time you think so more else is something worth note or to comment on keep it to yourself.
